# 💎 Perfume Finder: Luxury Analytics App

[**🟢 Live Demo Application**](https://perfume-finder-app-btskyvq7eytc5ujrgzr2dk.streamlit.app/)

## 📌 Project Overview
**Perfume Finder** is an interactive web application designed to bridge the gap between raw fragrance data and user experience. Unlike standard databases, this tool offers a "Luxury Tech" interface to filter thousands of perfumes based on olfactory notes, gender categories, and user ratings.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Advanced Filtering Logic:** Multi-parameter search (Gender, Olfactory Notes, Rating Threshold).
* **Data Cleaning Engine:** Custom Python algorithms (`brutal_clean`) to parse and standardize raw text data from Fragrantica.
* **Web Analytics (GA4):** Integrated **Google Analytics 4** to track user engagement, popular search filters, and session duration.
* **UX/UI Design:** Custom CSS implementation for a "Dark Luxury" aesthetic, utilizing gold accents (#D4AF37) and responsive glassmorphism.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.9+
* **Framework:** Streamlit
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas
* **Analytics:** Google Analytics 4 (via JS injection)

## 📊 Analytics Implementation
This project demonstrates **Web Analytics** skills by injecting custom JavaScript trackers into the Streamlit header. This allows for real-time monitoring of:
1.  Active users.
2.  Most filtered perfume notes.
3.  User retention rates.

## 📂 Data Source
Dataset sourced from [Kaggle (Fragrantica)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olgagmiufana1/fragrantica-com-fragrance-dataset).
*Note: The dataset `fra_perfumes.csv` is processed internally for optimal performance.*
