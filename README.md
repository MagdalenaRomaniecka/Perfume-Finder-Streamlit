# 🔎 Perfume Finder: Intelligent Fragrance Search Engine

## Project Goal

The **Perfume Finder** project is an interactive web application built using Streamlit and the Pandas library. Its purpose is to explore and filter a vast collection of perfumery data, enabling users to quickly find perfumes matched to their preferences based on main fragrance accords, gender, and rating score.

## Data Source

The application uses data downloaded from Kaggle—a dataset sourced from Fragrantica.com (specifically the `fra_perfumes.csv` file).

## Key Features

1. **Advanced Filtering:** Filter perfumes based on selected accords (e.g., "vanilla", "woody", "citrus"), gender, and a minimum user rating.

2. **Results Gallery:** Display matching perfumes in a dynamic gallery format with images and key information.

3. **Market Insights:** A second tab provides visual analysis of market trends, such as rating distribution and the most popular fragrance accords using Plotly.
